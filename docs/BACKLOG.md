# Backlog

Open work with no single line to mark.
`rg -n 'BUG:|TODO:'` lists the rest.

## Bugs and correctness

- Distinguish a definitive tier-2 absence from a transient repository probe failure.
  The latter must not silently fall through to synthesis, which can conceal a wrong repository or a network, tag, tree, release, or validation failure.
  Report the consulted repository and tier immediately; then decide between interactive confirmation and uniform refusal with an explicit synthesis override.
  This also decides whether `install --generate` remains necessary: ADR-0016's authoritative-first order makes forcing tier 3 normally worse, but it may be the deliberate replacement escape hatch.
- Distinguish a wrong documentation repository from one that legitimately has no manpage.
  Flag-inventory overlap and whether the repository contains implementation source are possible evidence, but absence is a normal synthesis fallback and must not be treated as proof of misresolution.
- Harden global Mise discovery when the login-path probe fails, rather than returning the caller's inherited, possibly project-activated PATH.
  A disposable probe confirmed activation is cwd-sensitive; the successful login-shell path run from `$HOME` correctly selects global `latest` installs.
  Exercise real shim resolution before choosing a safe fallback; `mise which -C $HOME` remains cwd-sensitive and needs ADR-0029-style root validation.
- Serialize manifest load-modify-save with a sidecar lock and transactional update API.
  Atomic replacement prevents torn files but not concurrent installs losing ownership entries; choose a short blocking timeout or a fail-fast lock policy.
- Disambiguate list rows whose grouping renders the same visible label for different binaries or states.
  Preserve bare-name pipeline output; choose either package-plus-binary labels or a width-capped binary list.
- Treat a multi-page upstream release as one uninstallable installation.
  Uninstalling the primary page must checksum-protect, remove, and restore every companion page and displaced vendor page.

## Refactors and architecture

- Decide whether `Config` binds XDG paths per instance or intentionally at import time, then make discovery consistent.
  Current frozen module globals make ordinary environment monkeypatches ineffective after import; this is a configuration-lifecycle decision deserving an ADR.
- Extend installation-derived package metadata fallback beyond npm for Python, Cargo, Go, and Homebrew.
  Never infer a repository from a bare executable name: prior collisions include `fmt` -> `nushell/nufmt`, `od` -> `todotxt/todo.txt-cli`, and GNU `envsubst` -> `a8m/envsubst`.
- Record losing provider claims for a binary after first-PATH-entry selection.
  The visible winner is correct, but discarded competing claims prevent diagnostics when PATH hides a better-documented installation.
- Tell transparent wrappers from genuinely different shadowing binaries only with evidence: compare `--version` for the first and later PATH occurrences.
  Do not fall through positionally; ADR-0020 rejected that because it can attribute another build's documentation.
  The current system has no live wrapper fixture, so this remains unbuilt.
- Add exact-file Source-link adapters for non-GitHub hosts only when verified against a real installation.
  Keep Source plain otherwise; clone URLs do not imply a safe browser-file URL.

## Features and discovery

- Admit bounded documentation roots in monorepos, with OpenCode's versioned English `packages/web/src/content/docs` as the fixture.
  Exclude dependency, build, translation, and unrelated workspace trees.
- Add package-provenance discovery for system candidates, beginning with batched Debian `dpkg-query` ownership plus source/homepage/copyright evidence.
  Keep downstream package VCS distinct from upstream identity, and defer other package-manager adapters until real installations exist.
- Extract bounded documentation from installed package roots and system packages: recognized local docs, Info pages, package metadata as supplementary context, and absolute-path help.
  Preserve each source's provenance.
- Feed an installed manpage into synthesis as authoritative reference material for flags, defaults, exits, and structure.
  Label it as reference evidence rather than a presentation model, so a poor page cannot anchor the generated result; validate the effect with `maniac compare`.
- Add tldr-pages as an examples source, preferring an installed tealdeer cache before its release zip and recording provenance in generated output.
  Its examples are additive; do not substitute it for authoritative option documentation.
- Consider Arch Wiki integration/configuration prose only after a reliable per-command extraction boundary exists.
  It is additive, but task-oriented articles and redirects make raw retrieval insufficient.
- Split the external `system` Source label into package-owned and other external pages, or rename it.
  A conservative roff-header verifier may establish freshness only on unambiguous title/package/version evidence.
- Add external-page freshness adapters for Arch, RPM-family systems, and Homebrew only with a real fixture.
  Unsupported systems must remain `unverified`, never guessed.
- Implement an update path for stale MANIAC-managed pages, including whether installation overwrites in place and when a vendor backup is retaken.
  Re-derive pre-version manifest entries by reinstalling rather than stamping current versions; make the repair resumable.
- Add a dense-table row guide only if it improves tested light and dark terminal output.
  A theme-safe alternating row style is the leading candidate.

## Verification and research

- Verify `maniac compare` against a live LLM and a real installed page; its current coverage mocks synthesis.
  The staged fzf context is ready when API access is available.
- Measure the coverage cost of refusing an unmatched upstream version before changing ADR-0016's version-match policy.
  Separate unusual tag conventions from genuine absence.
- Exercise standalone npm, pipx, and Homebrew `detect()` implementations against real installations.
  Existing mise-composed metadata coverage does not verify their path layouts.

## Deferred milestones

- Judge whether an existing vendor or shipped upstream manpage is worth replacing.
  ADR-0016 deliberately deferred the verdict layer; resume only with a robust classification model and real output to judge.
  `.HP` option counting has two known dead ends: unconditional counts mistake synopsis markers for options, and rendered bold-hyphen regexes miss common roff forms.
- Serve system and distro-packaged binaries.
  Debian provenance and local documentation are viable, but broad candidate enumeration and cross-package-manager support need batching and measured scope.

## Settled exclusions

- Do not use linuxcommandlibrary.com: its generated, lossy, weakly attributed corpus is not a trustworthy documentation source.
- Do not fetch man7.org, Debian/Ubuntu manpage mirrors, or GNU online manuals where local pages and Info already supply the same content.
  Install `manpages-dev` for missing local sections instead.
